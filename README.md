# InvestNow

![](InvestNow_gif.gif)

This is my project for Data Career Day at Algoritma School of Data Sciece. In this project I created a machine learning that can classify whether today an investor should buy or sell their stock.

This project was create to provide benefits to 3 parties: 
- Brokers can take advantage of this project as a feature to attract new investors to invest in stocks.
- Investors (individuals) can take advantage of this project to get additional income.
- The state will also benefit from this project since if the investors income increases, the income of the country will also increase.

# InvestNow - Behind The Scene

InvestNow was built in [R](https://www.r-project.org) , an open source programming language using the [Shiny package](https://shiny.rstudio.com), a web application framework for R. Users will need to download [R](https://cran.uni-muenster.de/) in order to use RadaR and we suggest the use of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). R is completely free to use. All required code and library used can be found in this github repositroy.
