# InvestNow

![](InvestNow_gif.gif)

This is my project for Data Career Day at Algoritma School of Data Sciece. In this project I created a machine learning that can classify whether today an investor should buy or sell their stock.

This project was create to provide benefits to 3 parties: 
- Brokers can take advantage of this project as a feature to attract new investors to invest in stocks.
- Investors (individuals) can take advantage of this project to get additional income.
- The state will also benefit from this project since if the investors income increases, the income of the country will also increase.
